# Photo backend

With the end of Google Photos free tier I want some way to replace that.
The goal of this repo is to write code that would allow the organization and categorization of photo libraries.
These photos and related data should then be made queryable through a secured REST interface.

## Key features 

- [ ] Automatic indexing of photos
- [ ] REST endpoint(s) to access indexed photos
- [ ] Auto generation and renewal of encryption certificates
- [ ] Allow photo uploads
- [ ] Optionally generate thumbnail preview of photos
- [ ] Allow filtering or selection by metadata (ex. date, location, etc.)
- [ ] Use trained network to try and identify objects in the photos to add to meta data (eventually)
